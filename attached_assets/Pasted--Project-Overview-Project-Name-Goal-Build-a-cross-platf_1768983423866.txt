# Project Overview
- **Project Name:** 올빼미Q
- **Goal:** Build a cross-platform mobile app (iOS & Android) using **React Native (Expo)**.
- **Target Audience:** Students (Users) and Teachers (Admins).

# Tech Stack
1. **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
2. **Backend:** **Supabase** (Database, Auth, Storage)

# ★ Core Feature: Whitelist & Seat Number Integration
To ensure security and identity verification, implement a **strict whitelist system** based on pre-uploaded academy data.

1. **Pre-filled Data:** There will be a table named `allowed_students` containing `name`, `phone_number`, and `seat_number`.
2. **Signup Logic:**
   - When a user tries to sign up with a phone number, the system checks if the number exists in `allowed_students`.
   - **If exists:** Allow the user to set a password and create an account.
   - **Crucial Step:** During account creation, automatically fetch the `seat_number` and `name` from `allowed_students` and save them into the user's `profiles` table.
   - **If not exists:** Block registration with an error message.

# detailed Features

## 1. Authentication (Phone + Password)
- **Login:** Users log in using their **Phone Number** and **Password**.
- **User Identity:** The app must always identify students by their **[Seat Number] + [Name]** (e.g., "Seat 24 - John Doe").

## 2. Reservation System (The Main Feature)
- **Schedule:** Monday to Friday, divided by class periods.
- **Capacity:** Max **4 students** per period.
- **Logic:**
  - Use **Supabase Realtime** to update slot availability instantly.
  - If a slot reaches 4 users, the button becomes disabled.

## 3. Student Features
- **Reserve a Question:**
  1. Select Day & Period.
  2. **Upload Photo (Mandatory):** Take a photo of the question or select from the gallery. Upload to **Supabase Storage**.
  3. Confirm Reservation.
- **My History:** View a list of past reservations and uploaded question photos.

## 4. Teacher Features (Admin Dashboard)
- **Dashboard:** Select a Day/Period to view reserved students.
- **UI Requirement:**
  - Display the reserved students in a list or grid.
  - **Emphasis:** The **[Seat Number]** must be visually prominent (e.g., a large badge or bold text) so the teacher can locate the student immediately.
  - Show the uploaded question photo preview.

# Database Schema (Supabase)
1. `allowed_students` (Whitelist Table)
   - id, name, phone_number, **seat_number** (Fixed desk number)
2. `profiles` (User Data)
   - id (uuid, references auth.users), name, phone_number, **seat_number**, role ('student' or 'teacher')
3. `schedules`
   - id, day_of_week, period_number, current_count (int)
4. `questions`
   - id, user_id (fk to profiles), schedule_id (fk to schedules), photo_url (string), created_at

# Design Guidelines
- **Theme:** Navy and Blue colors to represent trust and education.
- **UI/UX:** Clean and intuitive.
- **Identity:** Always display the **Seat Number** next to the student's name in the UI.
